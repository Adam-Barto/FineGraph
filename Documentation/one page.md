# Passion Project: Fine Graph

Fine Graph is an app that helps you keep track of your spending, as well as providing easy to understand graphs to help you wrap your head around your month to month, year to year financing. Imagine you want to keep track of your average food costs per year, or graph your charity donations into a more easy to follow format. This app will allow you perform these functions, and export the graphs as well. 

While many people store their financial databases in excel spreadsheets, it can be complex to graph across multiple sheets. Fine graph makes it easy to store and graph your data, displaying it for easy readability.


My MVP will be an app where the user can upload transactions, add notes, graph the data based on factors such as year and category, and export a graph of the data.

I will be using Python, SQL Alchemy, Flask, and for the front end HTML and Javascript
